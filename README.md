# ml-class-2011

My homework for the original machine learning massive online open course (ml-class.org) by Andrew Ng, pre-Coursera.

I remember enjoying this course, it shaped my interests on both machine learning and MOOC development. 

Professor Ng did a great job preparing its content, I'd like to get him to sign this IRL.
